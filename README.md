# C
C programming from 0! I am using Raspberry pi 4B with Raspbi OS (no desktop) with nano editor!

* I went to the home direction and created a file with the name "first.c" : touch first.c and nano first.c
* To run the c program , you should create an object file from it : cc first.c -o first
* Make it executable : chmod +x first
* To run your object file : ./first

first.c - program to print "Hello World"

second.c - multiplies two variables a =6 and b=5 and assignes it to c. Prints out : a x b = c

simple_calculator.c - asks to enter an operand and two numbers for your chosen operation. Prints the result depending on the chosen operation

pyramid_ast.c - asks for a number of rows and prints a pyramid from * 

trig_ratios.c - Enter an angle in degrees and get trigonometrical ratios as a result
